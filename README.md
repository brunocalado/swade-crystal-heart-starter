## Want to roll some DICE?
Inspired by anime and superhero comics, the Crystal Heart roleplaying setting for Savage Worlds was developed in the webcomic Up to Four Players as the characters were playing it. Now you too can become a Syn Agent, explore ancient locations and hunt down powerful Crystals! Replace your heart with a Crystal and gain superpowers! (also lose your mind; but just a little).

Suitable for everyone, from first-time players to savvy Game Master of many years!
The Starter Set includes:
- Introduction to the world and rules of Crystal Heart
- Five ready-made Agent characters
- Starter adventure
- A summary sheet for the Crystal rules
- Two-page comics explaining how to play Savage Worlds
