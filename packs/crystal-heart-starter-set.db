For months, they were able to keep their operation a secret, coming and going on occasion, until eventually the weapon was finished and needed to be tested. For this, Shi-ha was sent to requisition the Crystal Bam-Bam, a highly energetic and powerful Crystal. The two figured it would be a perfect fit for the weapon.</p><p>@UUID[.f9bqZjspRVaTcohK]{Bircht Verzonin}</p><p>@UUID[.FsP3B60YdIOT7l4i]{Icicle Mines}</p><p>In the meantime, Shi-ha also developed a crude Crystal-replacement breathing apparatus, to allow her to keep breathing even after Bam-Bam was taken out. It was meant to be used only briefly, during the tests.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.6zVnV0vXuLta4QFm]{Shi-Ha}</p><p>Bam-Bam didn’t work, at all. It was too energetic, and Albrecht and Shi-ha decided they needed something smoother, softer. After a little research, Albrecht concluded the best Crystal for the job is <strong>Cozy Warmth</strong>, a pretty weak Crystal that helps you keep warm, and not much else. It was being carried by <strong>Oli Danford</strong>, another Free Agent, who luckily was currently investigating an ancient, albeit boring, ice city from the Bygone Age, not far from the outpost. (Perhaps a different Crystal would have worked even better, but Albrecht was starting to become worried he’d be discovered.)</p><p>@UUID[Item.iVbDDUdu6W3Te8SJ]{Cozy Warmth}</p><p>About ten days ago, Albrecht and Shi-ha went after Oli Danford. They confronted him in the cave of the ice city, and Albrecht demanded the Crystal. Oli refused, opposed to the idea of weaponised Crystals, leading Albrecht to murder him on the spot and taking his Crystal, installing it in the weapon.</p><p>Shi-ha stood there, aghast—she didn’t realize how far Albrecht was willing to go. The two argued, and Albrecht, masterfully lying, “agreed” that he “went too far” and suggested they return to the workshop. He then shot her with the weapon, de-syncing her, leaving her incapacitated. That wasn’t enough, so he also took Bam-Bam out of her harness and threw it away, leaving Shi-ha to suffocate. Bam-Bam quickly became feral, and Shi-ha barely managed to equip herself with the breathing apparatus that she had brought along (thinking it’d help with the peaceful transfer of Crystals), and ran away, escaping to the workshop in the mines.</p><p>Albrecht, holding the completed weapon, had one last thing he had to do: cover his tracks. He went back to the Syn castle, and called in some favors to make sure he’ll be overseeing the next team of trainee Novice Agents going into the field. He knew that since Oli won’t be reporting back, Bircht Verzonin will send a request for a check up on him; a simple mission for trainee Novice Agents.</p><p>His plan was to come along with them, let them discover the crime scene, and “help” them show that Shi-ha and Oli killed each other, leaving himself free from any implication.</p><p>During the adventure, Albrecht will behave in the following way.</p><p>First, he’ll keep a perfect demeanor as an annoyed, bored senior Agent, “burdened” with having to keep track of the group. He’ll establish himself as a lazy, useless mentor, who spends his time in the plane, having locked himself inside just to keep away from the inexperienced junior Agents. He’ll be only half interested in anything the junior Agents have to say, expecting this mission to be “so simple even you guys can’t screw it up”.</p><p>When the group shows him that Oli is dead, he’ll become serious and efficient. An Agent was murdered; and by another Agent, you say? This is unheard of. He’ll demand to close this investigation and fly them all back to the castle, to send “real agents” to investigate this, secretly expecting the party to refuse, wishing to try and prove themselves in some way. The more havoc they cause, the easier it’ll be for him to blame everything on someone else.</p><p>Upon discovering Shi-ha might not be dead, he’ll try to contact her using the radio tower in the outpost, secretly accessing it through a door in the roof. He’ll use whatever lie he needs to place her in whatever disadvantageous position he can, while sending the PCs to take care of her, emphasizing how dangerous she is. He will demonize her in their eyes, making use of any trust he might have built with the PCs (especially after suddenly showing “his true colors” and becoming “heroic” after hearing of Oli’s death), and warn them not to take Shi-ha, “a famously dangerous Agent”, lightly.</p><p>At some point, Albrecht might even join the PCs (probably when going after Shi-ha), just to make sure things go his way. “After you showed me Oli was dead, I was thinking of taking command of this mission, but you know what, this is still your first field test, and I’m still your mentor; so it’s your decision how to handle it, and I’ll be accompanying you.” Optionally, he’ll track the Agents stealthily, from afar.</p><p>Albrecht will probably eventually find himself having to face the PCs in combat. He’s completely sure he can take them on, he simply prefers not to, since they’re a lot more useful in corroborating his story.</p><p>He prefers to face them inside the plane or in the workshop; he has a home advantage in both, being able to control the plane’s flight and the workshop’s turrets. He is not above suggesting “they join him”, trying to make them betray each other, then simply betraying whomever is left.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.1Y7heUni8NumFLWM]{Albrecht Davidheimer}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Timeline of events","type":"text","_id":"5YOMSW8OUAs2SMD6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Timeline of events</h1><p>A Syn auto-plane arrives to resupply the outpost every 7 days.</p><ul><li><p><strong>10 days ago:</strong> Albrecht and Shi-ha confront Oli; Albrecht kills him, shoots She-Ha and leaves her to die</p></li><li><p><strong>8 days ago:</strong> Oli misses a check-in visit to the outpost; Helga gets worried.

The denizens of each Land consider themselves part of the same “people”, despite not having an actual nation (except for Zingama, which has a well-established unified government and a national identity).</p><p></p><h2>The Five Lands</h2><p><strong>Bogovia</strong> is the land of dark forests and bleak swamps, of wolves howling in the night against gloomy scenery. Bogovian folk tales are all about grim endings, bitter sacrifices and Pyrrhic victories, with a stubborn hero who refuses to surrender at any cost. Bogovians dress in thick, well-worn fabrics and huddle in small villages, each with its own strange customs and superstitions.</p><p><strong>Fjordstad</strong> is the land of ice and storms, where the Eleven Cities fight each other over resources and respect. Fjordstadians will act either behind your back, with highly trained spies engaging in industrial espionage, or in your face with mad engineers who’ll blow you up with their latest death ray. Fjordstadian nobles tend to dress in elaborate multi-layered suits with various hidden compartments, whereas commoners are more likely to be seen in overalls. All of them, regardless of social status, are known for being elitist and condescending—especially toward each other.</p><p><strong>The Islands</strong> are varied and eccentric, both culturally and geographically. Some islands are large trading hubs that are among the most cosmopolitan and pleasant places in the world, while others are remote, isolated and untamed. The islands vary in climate, but loose clothing and simple jewelery are common almost everywhere. Islanders are quick to relax, focusing on the here and now. Some of them, of course, are pirates.</p><p><strong>Maseia</strong> is the land of open plains, countless lakes and naturally-occurring flying mountains. Dozens of Maseian clans travel the plains and valleys, focusing on self-discovery, enlightenment, and living off the land. Their societies have tight structures, with stiff traditions and strict social mores. Maseians dress in ways that reflect their role within their clan.</p><p><strong>Zingama</strong> is the land of slithering and poisonous things, a huge jungle criss-crossed by the longest river in the world. A massive government rules over more than a million people, who live mostly in urban settlements along the river. Zingamaians talk politics all day and party all night, proud of being a world-class cultural and industrial power. Dress, hairstyle, slang, and even pets all change on a seasonal basis, according to the latest fads.

Even the best experts know little about the people who came before, and no one knows why their powerful society was annihilated. The person on the street only knows that several centuries ago, history began almost from scratch.</p><p>The Bygone Age left various remnants throughout the world. Most are ancient, strange machines or structures half-buried in the ground. One island might have a Bygone Age forcefield that keeps everyone inside healthy, or a village in Bogovia might be built on a metallic platform that doesn’t sink into the swamp. The most important remnants are, of course, the Crystals.</p><p></p><h2>Present Day</h2><p>The people of the Lands still don’t know a lot about their world. After spending hundreds of years in internal strife, rebuilding society on the skeletons of the past, they have only recently begun to coalesce into what might be called proto-nations.</p><p>The thirst for knowledge and progress is there, even if the means for establishing and maintaining production lines are still out of reach. One Fjordstadian city might have cars, and many of them have electric street lights, but these are seen as trade secrets to be kept hidden from rivals. There’s even a train between some of the Fjordstadian cities and Maseia—but it’s the only train line in the entire world. Zingamaian scholars are making their first steps into the field of archeology, trying to uncover their own past. Deep within the Bogovian forests, high on Maseian mountains, in the jungles of Zingama, beneath Fjordstadian ice, and all across the Islands, countless secrets remain hidden.</p><p>One power in the world, however, seems to be ahead of everyone else by a generation at least: Syn.</p><p></p><h2>The Rise of Syn</h2><p>About 20 years ago, an organization named Syn began recruiting and training special Agents, replacing their hearts with harnesses —a never-seen-before technology. Syn existed for some time before this, but it was the arrival of the Agents that brought the organization to the public’s eye.</p><p>Most Agents are trained as Crystal Hunters. Syn’s intelligence team provides them with a designated route to follow for several months, usually passing through two Lands. During a hunt the Agents are expected to follow the rumors Syn has gathered beforehand, as well as to explore on their own and recover any Crystals found. At the end of a route the group returns to Syn’s headquarters: a huge, high-tech flying citadel.</p><p>Syn scholars discovered the secret to utilizing Crystals safely and predictably by way of the harness, but they are far from being the only ones who try.

Even the most high-ranked Agents only use these on occasion, as they are highly regulated and usually kept in the vaults. Most use Veteran Crystals instead.</p><p>Only five <strong>Legendary Crystals</strong> were ever discovered, and only the five members of the Council of Syn are allowed to carry them. Rumors claim these Crystals are too powerful.</p><p></p><h2>Theme</h2><p>A Crystal’s theme is its main concept—what it’s about. The theme is manifested in the Crystals’ powers and their trappings. The more an Agent understands a Crystal’s theme, the more new powers they can create out of it (with Power Stunts, next page). Syn has a good understanding of the themes of most of the Crystals in their Repository, but some are only half understood (and some are misunderstood).</p><p>Casual Use: Most themes can manifest in simple ways without needing a Crystal Channeling roll. Such casual uses can add +1 to a relevant Trait check, but can never be activated against someone or something else, or while under stress (such as during a combat situation). If there’s any hint of effort, this is no longer a casual use—it’s a Power Stunt (see next page).</p><p>Players should feel free to suggest casual uses for their Crystals as long as they maintain the themes.</p><p>Each Crystal’s theme is followed in italics with several suggestions for casual use.</p><p></p><h2>Benefit</h2><p>Each Crystal has one or more abilities which are always active. Simply having a Crystal inside you is enough to give you some sort of an advantage—usually an Edge, but occasionally an ongoing die upgrade to one or more of your Traits. All powers that are not part of your benefit must be activated as an action, usually with a Crystal Channeling check.</p><p></p><h2>Disposition</h2><p>A Crystal influences its bearer’s psyche. This is usually in the form of a personality trait but occasionally a physical disability, and it is always related in some way to its theme. The disposition is usually expressed in the form of Hindrances. The Agent socketing the Crystal is affected by its disposition at all times.</p><p></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>A Crystal gives its user access to several powers that share a common theme.</p><p>Most of the powers presented in this book are used differently than in Savage Worlds, as explained in each entry.</p><ul><li><p>The power’s in-world name is given first. This is the name Agents usually use to describe this power.</p></li><li><p>The name is followed by parentheses, with the power’s Savage Worlds name, and an indication if it can be used as Ongoing (see next page) and what its activation modifier is. When two or more powers are listed, they are all activated together with the same roll.</p></li><li><p>The power’s rules are then listed. Assume the power functions as it does in Savage Worlds unless noted otherwise here.</p></li><li><p>If the power allows any optional Modifiers, they are listed last. The common Modifiers are noted only if they’re always activated; otherwise, they can be used if it makes sense (see Power Modifiers, next page).</p></li></ul><img src=\"modules/swade-crystal-heart-starter/assets/arts/10.webp\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1000000,"name":"Are Crystals Magic?","type":"text","_id":"6LHd9pUtwDHIEQtw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Are Crystals Magic?</h1><blockquote><p>Syn is clear on the subject: Crystals are natural.

It’s a mental exercise practiced using both biofeedback and psychological techniques.</p><p>Arcane Background (Crystal Channeling) does not use Power Points. Agents simply choose the power they want to activate, and if it requires a check, they make a Crystal Channeling roll. This skill is based on Spirit and is a core skill for all Agents (they begin play with a d4 in it). Activating a power doesn’t usually require speaking, but some might require gestures. When a power is activated the Crystal glows with its distinctive color, usually bright enough to be visible through clothes.</p><p>The Crystal Channeling check is made with a penalty equal to half the Power Point cost of the power (rounded up) as noted in Savage Worlds. This penalty is usually listed.</p><p></p><h2>Activating a Power</h2><p>Once a power is activated with a roll, check the results below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Success:</strong> The power activates as normal. Assume the power follows the rules as noted in Savage Worlds, unless otherwise noted in the Crystal’s description.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raise:</strong> A raise on the roll grants any additional bonuses stated in the power’s description.</p></li><li><p><strong>Failure:</strong> The power doesn’t activate. You can choose instead to make it activate (as if your final result was a 4), by taking a level of Fatigue that can only be reduced by a few minutes of meditation with no active powers. If this makes you Incapacitated, the power activates before you’re out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> Treated as a failure, and you also desync (see next page).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Maintaining Powers:</strong> All non-instant powers can be maintained for as long as the character desires (dismissed as a free action) but each power maintained inflicts a -1 on Crystal Channeling rolls.</p><p>Power Modifiers: To use a Power Modifier, subtract from the roll half of its cost rounded up. This is usually -1, so it’s safe to default to it. For those who want to be as technically correct as possible, add the Power Point costs of the power and the Modifier, then halve the sum.</p><p>Each power lists the Power Modifiers it allows. The common Modifiers (see Power Modifiers in Savage Worlds) are generally allowed, but only with a good rationale and the GM’s permission. Exactly how it works is a matter of description, but it must always be relevant to the Crystal’s theme.</p><p><strong>Power Preparation:</strong> An Agent may prepare powers by concentrating for an entire round (no movement or other actions, and they must not be Shaken or Stunned). If successful, they ignore 2 points of penalties on all Crystal Channeling rolls on their next turn.</p><p><strong>Ongoing Powers:</strong> Outside of tense situations, such as combat, activating Ongoing powers does not require a roll. The Agent takes a few moments to focus themselves and release the potential from within the Crystal. They can even choose to activate the power as if they got a raise on the roll. During an action scene, activating an Ongoing power requires an action and a Crystal Channeling roll like any other power.</p><p>Ongoing powers always come with a drawback. An activated power reflects switching the Crystal to a higher setting—you become stronger, but so does the disposition.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"Power Stunts","type":"text","_id":"ckKxV1qfpEOGVWOx","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Power Stunts</h1><p>The powers within a Crystal represent only some of the uses of its theme, which come reflexively to its bearer.

Although rare, Syn has recorded cases of a Heroic Crystal with a lightning theme manifesting as little pricks of static electricity, and of a Novice Crystal with a softness theme manifesting as quicksand that can swallow buildings. The environmental conditions surrounding the feral Crystal seem to have a large influence on the form and intensity of its manifestation.</p><p></p><h2>Containment Procedures</h2><p>Each Agent is provided with two Crystal containers: one that holds the Crystal in their own harness, and an extra one to contain feral Crystals. The container has a sliding lid and is filled with soft gel which needs to be replaced every few months.</p><p>When approaching a feral Crystal, Syn Agents are advised to first subdue any manifestations such as walking trees, choking water snakes, or zombified corpses. This allows for a short period of calm, usually around ten minutes, before the Crystal re-manifests its theme. During this time the Agents should place the Crystal inside a container using gloves.</p><p>If subduing the manifestations is not feasible (what can you do against an avalanche?), a feral Crystal can also be tamed by being held for several seconds in a container, a harness, or someone’s hands. Crystals really don’t like being held like this and tend to react in unexpected ways, akin to an angry cat.</p><p>Agents are advised to wear gloves while handling feral Crystals. For some unknown reason—perhaps something about the way the energies of two Crystals clash—when an Agent touches a feral Crystal barehanded, they must roll Vigor or take a level of Fatigue. On a Critical Failure, they desync! This roll repeats at the start of every turn until the Agent releases the Crystal or it becomes tamed, as noted below.</p><p><strong>Grappling with a Crystal:</strong> Trying to grab a feral Crystal or trap it in a container is similar to grappling. Most times it requires an Athletics roll to grab the Crystal, at -2 if you’re trying to push it into a container.</p><p>The Crystal must be held down for several seconds, forcing a Strength roll on your following turn to keep it secured (with +2 if you’ve got it in a container). If the Crystal fails to escape, it calms down and stops being feral, all of its manifestations disappearing.
